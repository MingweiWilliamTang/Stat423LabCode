# Stat423LabCode
This is the lab code that I designed for the quiz section of Stat 423 (Linear regression) at UW in winter 2016. The code covers the statistical inferred in simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and model selection. Please feel free to download and play with it. Have fun in statistics.
